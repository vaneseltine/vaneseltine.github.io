      I study the effects of scientific infrastructure, training, and initiatives,
      and lately I'm 
      especially interested in open science and reproducible research.
      I also contribute to open source projects in Python,

        This pilot demonstrates that substantive evaluations
        of even relatively small-scale career development programs 
        are possible using administrative data from universities with 
        low burden on specific programs.

        The relative neglect of replication research in criminology is somewhat
        surprising [&hellip;] opportunities for organizing something akin to a

        If marriage affects antisocial behavior by increasing responsibilities,

        Criminal activity drops significantly following the birth of a first
        child. After several years, however, this drop fades. By the time the
        child is around age nine, the parent’s crime is, on average, no
        different than we would have expected if they had remained
        childless.
